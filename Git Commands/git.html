        <h1>Git</h1>
        <p >Git is a distributed version control system that allows multiple developers to collaborate on a project,
         track changes to files, and manage project history. It keeps track of all the changes made to files,
          enabling you to revert to previous versions, collaborate with others, and maintain a clean history
          of changes. Git is widely used in software development for managing source code.</p>

          <h3>The 3 Stages in Git:</h3>
          <br>
          <p>  Git has a three-stage process for managing changes to files:</p>
          <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">1. Working Directory (Working Tree)</span> What it is: The working directory is the directory where your project files reside on your local machine. It’s
             where you make changes to files, such as editing, adding, or deleting files. What happens here: When you edit or create files in your project, these files
              are considered to be in the working directory. Git doesn’t track these changes until they are added to the staging area. Example: You edit a file called 
              index.html in your project directory.
            </p>
          <p> <span style="font-weight: bold;">2.Staging Area (Index)</span> What it is: The staging area is a temporary area where you place changes you want to commit. It's like a holding area for change
             You use git add to stage the changes in the files that you want to commit. This allows you to selectively commit changes. Example: You make edits to index.html
              and style.css. After editing, you run git add index.html to stage the changes for the next commit.
            </p>
            <p>
               <span style="font-weight: bold;">3. Git Repository (Local Repository)</span> What it is: The staging area is a temporary area where you place changes you want to commit. It's like a holding area for changes
                 that will become part of the next commit. You decide which changes should be included in the commit by adding them to the staging area. What happens here:
                  You use git add to stage the changes in the files that you want to commit. This allows you to selectively commit changes. Example: You make edits to index.html
                   and style.css. After editing, you run git add index.html to stage the changes for the next commit.
            </p>

            <h1>GitHub:</h1>
            <p>
                GitHub is a cloud-based platform that provides hosting for Git repositories. It is built around Git, a distributed version control system, but it adds extra
                functionality to improve collaboration and project management. GitHub is widely used for version control and collaboration, especially in open-source projects.
                 It provides a user-friendly interface for managing repositories, tracking issues, and reviewing code.
            </p>
